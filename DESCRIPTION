Title: Interlog protein network reconstruction by Mapping and Mining ANalysis
Version: 1.18.0
Description: Reconstructing Interlog Protein Network (IPN) integrated from several 
             Protein protein Interaction Networks (PPINs). Using this package, 
             overlaying different PPINs to mine conserved common networks between diverse 
             species will be applicable.
